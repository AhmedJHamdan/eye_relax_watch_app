## 📖 The 20/20/20 Principle

The **20/20/20 principle** is a simple guideline recommended by optometrists to alleviate digital eye strain:

- **Every 20 minutes**, take a **20-second** break.
- Look at something **20 feet** away.

This practice helps to relax the focusing muscle inside the eye, reducing fatigue and discomfort associated with extended screen use.
